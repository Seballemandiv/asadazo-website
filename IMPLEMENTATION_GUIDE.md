## Current Status âœ…

- âœ… Contact form is ready and styled
- âœ… On Request form is ready and styled  
- âœ… Both forms have proper validation and error handling
- âœ… Forms are set up to send emails to `allemandi.Sebastian@expandam.nl`
- âœ… Build is working correctly
- âœ… **Formspree endpoint configured**: `https://formspree.io/f/mldwllla`

## Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your forms are now fully configured and ready to send emails! Here's what's been set up:

### âœ… **What's Working**
- **Contact Form**: Sends emails via Formspree to `allemandi.Sebastian@expandam.nl`
- **On Request Form**: Sends cut requests with image uploads via Formspree
- **Formspree Integration**: Both forms use your endpoint `https://formspree.io/f/mldwllla`
- **Email Forwarding**: All submissions will be forwarded to your specified email address

### ðŸ“§ **How It Works**
1. User fills out either form
2. Form submits to Formspree
3. Formspree forwards the email to `allemandi.Sebastian@expandam.nl`
4. You receive the email with all form details
5. User sees a success confirmation

## Testing Your Forms

1. **Start dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Test Contact Form**: 
   - Go to `/contact`
   - Fill out the form and submit
   - Check your email at `allemandi.Sebastian@expandam.nl`
3. **Test On Request Form**:
   - Go to `/on-request`
   - Upload an image, fill out details, and submit
   - Check your email for the request details

## Current Features
